# hello-world
If only I could be one of the Tech Gods my goodness how wonderfully fulfilling that would be!
I have been involved with computers and assorted branches since I was bitten by the BUG in 1977 and have obsessed since then like a child in the largest vasted CANDY STORE! I thank all the GURUS which have and had the where with all to create the many Elements that make up and continue to make the GALAXY OF THE DIGITAL FRAMEWORK OF COMMUNICATION!
